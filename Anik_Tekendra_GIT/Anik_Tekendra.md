# Review of GIT Assignment
Git document sender: **Anik Barua**

Document Reviewer: **Tekendra Timsina**

Following is my outline from the documents of Anik I graded.
1.  He implemented it well and sent me the screenshot of all the command from terminal. Also, He sent the screenshot of PyCharm and Github repository.
2.  Only missing commands i noticed from his note was ...
```sh
                    $ git log
```
3. yes, they make sense and were correctly done except few which i discussed with him personally.
4. From his document, I learned the command i have not personally used.
```sh
                    $ git commit --amend
```
5. One command that i have used but not included here.
```sh
                    $ git show
```
6. This interactive website really help me to upgrade my understanding on git.

  * The definition and examples of each command are really simple and easy to understand.
  * Previously I had confusion with some commands such as git rebase, git cherry-pick but now I got the clear concept on them with the help of this interactive visualisation tutorial.
  * Also, there were quite many commands that are totally new for me such as relative Refs(^,~), rebase -i, describe etc.

Overall, this website was a good source to learn as it provides clear concepts on each command and also test you by letting you do it yourself interactively.
